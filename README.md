## Personal Depersonalization System

[Personal Depersonalization System](http://bengrosser.com/projects/personal-depersonalization-system/) is an automated query machine that depersonalizes my Google profile by hiding my real interests and inclinations within a sea of random noise. The work grabs words from Websterâ€™s 1934 Second International dictionary, searches for them, and selects one of the results to visit. It also occasionally changes locations and meta search categories.  It was first exhibited in the peer-reviewed show *Accepted Knowing* at *Figure One* in Champaign, IL, July 2011.
